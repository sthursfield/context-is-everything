      "chat": {
        "pricing": {
          "question": "What's your pricing?",
          "answer": "We offer three engagement models: A 48-hour Proof of Value to demonstrate results on your specific challenge (minimal investment), a 4-6 week Pilot Program for limited scope validation, or a 12+ week Full Implementation for comprehensive transformation. Each includes clear success metrics and ROI tracking. We price based on value delivered, not time spent. Our procurement case found £200K in hidden costs in just 48 hours - the ROI was over 4000%."
        },

        "vs_big_consulting": {
          "question": "How are you different from Accenture/McKinsey/Big 4?",
          "answer": "Big consultancies excel at standardized frameworks and large-scale transformations. We excel when you need AI that understands YOUR specific context. For instance, when we helped an insurance brokerage, we didn't apply 'best practices' - we understood that California regulations differ from Texas, that medical aesthetics has unique risks. Result: 150% conversion improvement. Big firms would have automated their existing processes. We eliminated 85% of their middleware because we understood it added no value in their specific context."
        },

        "guarantee": {
          "question": "Do you guarantee results?",
          "answer": "We guarantee you'll see measurable value within 48 hours through our Proof of Value engagement. Our documented track record shows consistent results: 95% time reductions, 150% conversion improvements, £200K+ cost discoveries. We build success metrics into every engagement and track them transparently. If our initial proof of value doesn't demonstrate clear ROI potential, we'll tell you honestly rather than pursue a project that won't deliver value."
        },

        "data_not_ready": {
          "question": "What if our data isn't ready for AI?",
          "answer": "Perfect data is a myth that stops organizations from starting. We've worked with companies whose data was in spreadsheets, PDFs, even paper documents. Our procurement analysis handled Excel files with complex formulas, PDFs with embedded tables, and Word documents with mixed formats - and still found £200K in hidden costs. Part of our Context Discovery phase is understanding your data reality and working within it, not demanding perfection that doesn't exist."
        },

        "already_have_vendor": {
          "question": "We already have an AI vendor/tool",
          "answer": "Many clients come to us after generic AI tools disappointed. One insurance client had already tried three different platforms - all failed because they didn't understand the nuances of medical aesthetics insurance. We don't replace everything; we make AI work for your specific context. Often, we can enhance what you have by adding the context layer that makes it actually deliver value. Our approach complements existing investments rather than requiring you to start over."
        },

        "timeline": {
          "question": "How long does implementation take?",
          "answer": "We deliver value at three speeds: 48 hours for a Proof of Value that demonstrates ROI on a specific challenge. 4-6 weeks for a pilot that validates the approach in a limited scope. 12+ weeks for full implementation with complete transformation. The insurance brokerage saw their first improved conversions within 2 weeks of starting. The key is we show value quickly, then scale what works."
        },

        "too_complex": {
          "question": "Our business is too complex/unique for AI",
          "answer": "Complexity is exactly why you need Context-First AI. Generic AI fails with complexity, but context-aware AI thrives on it. The insurance brokerage thought their state-by-state regulations and service-specific risks were too complex - we turned that complexity into competitive advantage with 150% conversion improvement. The more unique your situation, the more value we can deliver by understanding it."
        },

        "failed_before": {
          "question": "We've tried AI before and it failed",
          "answer": "You're in good company - MIT Sloan reports 70% of companies see minimal impact from AI. The failure wasn't your fault; it was the approach. Generic AI fails because it doesn't understand your context. We've helped companies succeed after multiple failures by starting with understanding, not technology. Our insurance client had tried automation three times before we helped them achieve 150% improvement."
        },

        "roi_skeptical": {
          "question": "How do we know we'll see ROI?",
          "answer": "Start with our 48-hour Proof of Value. We'll take your biggest pain point and show measurable improvement using your actual data. No hypotheticals, no demos - real results. Our verified track record: procurement client saw 4000% ROI (£200K found for £5K investment), insurance client got 150% conversion improvement plus $200K annual savings. We measure everything and report transparently."
        },

        "internal_team": {
          "question": "Can't we just build this internally?",
          "answer": "You could, but consider: Our insurance client had internal teams working on their conversion problem for two years. We solved it in 12 weeks because we brought context expertise from across industries. Building internally means learning expensive lessons yourself. Working with us means benefiting from patterns we've already discovered. Plus, we transfer knowledge to your team so you can maintain and evolve what we build."
        },

        "security_concerns": {
          "question": "How do you handle data security/privacy?",
          "answer": "Security through simplicity is our approach. For the insurance brokerage, we eliminated 85% of their middleware - fewer systems mean fewer vulnerabilities. We work within your security requirements, whether that's on-premise deployment, private cloud, or using your existing infrastructure. For the education analysis, we worked entirely with public domain information yet still revealed critical insights. We adapt to your security needs, not the other way around."
        },

        "industry_experience": {
          "question": "Do you have experience in our industry?",
          "answer": "We've worked across industries - insurance, procurement, education, financial services, healthcare. But here's the key: Context-First methodology means we learn YOUR specific context, not apply generic industry templates. The insurance brokerage benefited from our procurement experience (we spotted their hidden costs using patterns from vendor analysis). Cross-industry insights often deliver breakthrough value."
        },

        "scale_concern": {
          "question": "Can this scale across our organization?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. The insurance brokerage went from handling 700-800 leads to having 10x capacity without adding staff. Our solutions are designed to scale - that's why we eliminate complexity rather than add it. We build in phases, proving value in one area then expanding. Each success makes the next implementation faster and more valuable."
        },

        "maintenance": {
          "question": "What happens after implementation?",
          "answer": "We build solutions your team can maintain and evolve. Knowledge transfer is built into our process. For the insurance brokerage, we eliminated 85% of maintenance overhead by simplifying their architecture. We can provide ongoing support if needed, but our goal is to make you self-sufficient. Many clients engage us periodically for optimization as their context evolves."
        },

        "why_now": {
          "question": "Why is this urgent now?",
          "answer": "Accenture reports 75% of executives believe they must scale AI within 5 years or risk going out of business. But here's the real urgency: while competitors struggle with generic AI that doesn't work, you could be building context-aware AI that creates lasting advantage. The insurance brokerage went from 20% to 50% conversion while competitors still use paper forms. The gap between context-aware and generic AI widens every day."
