        "pricing": {
          "question": "What's your pricing?",
          "answer": "We offer flexible engagement models tailored to your needs and scope. These typically range from focused pilot programs (4-6 weeks) to comprehensive implementations (12+ weeks). We price based on value delivered and complexity of the challenge. Each engagement includes clear success metrics and ROI tracking. For context, our procurement analysis identified £200K in hidden costs, while our insurance implementation delivered 150% conversion improvements. We're happy to discuss what investment level makes sense for your specific situation."
        },

        "vs_big_consulting": {
          "question": "How are you different from Accenture/McKinsey/Big 4?",
          "answer": "Big consultancies excel at standardized frameworks and large-scale transformations. We excel when you need AI that understands YOUR specific context. For instance, when we helped an insurance brokerage, we didn't apply generic 'best practices' - we understood that California regulations differ from Texas, that medical aesthetics has unique risks. The result was a 150% conversion improvement. Big firms typically automate existing processes. We identified and eliminated unnecessary complexity, finding that 85% of their middleware added no value in their specific context."
        },

        "guarantee": {
          "question": "Do you guarantee results?",
          "answer": "While we can't guarantee specific outcomes, our track record demonstrates consistent value delivery. We've achieved results including 95% time reductions, 150% conversion improvements, and identified hundreds of thousands in hidden costs. We build clear success metrics into every engagement and track progress transparently. Most importantly, we'll give you an honest assessment of potential value before proceeding with any major implementation. If we don't believe we can deliver meaningful ROI, we'll tell you upfront."
        },

        "data_not_ready": {
          "question": "What if our data isn't ready for AI?",
          "answer": "Perfect data is a myth that stops organizations from starting. We've successfully worked with companies whose data was in spreadsheets, PDFs, even paper documents. Our procurement analysis handled Excel files with complex formulas, PDFs with embedded tables, and Word documents with mixed formats - and still identified £200K in hidden costs. Part of our Context Discovery phase involves understanding your data reality and working within it. We help you leverage the data you have, not wait for perfection that doesn't exist."
        },

        "already_have_vendor": {
          "question": "We already have an AI vendor/tool",
          "answer": "Many clients come to us after generic AI tools haven't delivered expected results. We don't necessarily replace everything; instead, we often help make existing investments work better by adding the context layer that enables actual value delivery. Our approach can complement your current tools, helping them understand your specific business context. We've seen this work well - adding contextual understanding to existing systems rather than starting from scratch."
        },

        "timeline": {
          "question": "How long does implementation take?",
          "answer": "Implementation timelines vary based on scope and complexity. Typically, we see initial value demonstrations within 2-4 weeks, pilot validations complete in 4-6 weeks, and full implementations ranging from 12-16 weeks. The insurance brokerage case showed improvements emerging within the first few weeks, with full transformation over three months. The key is starting with focused areas where we can demonstrate value, then scaling what works. Every organization's journey is different, and we tailor timelines to your specific needs and constraints."
        },

        "too_complex": {
          "question": "Our business is too complex/unique for AI",
          "answer": "Complexity is actually where Context-First AI shines. Generic AI fails with complexity, but context-aware AI can navigate intricate requirements. The insurance brokerage initially thought their state-by-state regulations and service-specific risks were too complex for automation. By understanding their specific context, we achieved a 150% conversion improvement. In our experience, the more unique your situation, the more value we can potentially deliver by building AI that truly understands your specific requirements."
        },

        "failed_before": {
          "question": "We've tried AI before and it failed",
          "answer": "You're not alone - MIT Sloan reports that 70% of companies see minimal impact from AI initiatives. These failures typically stem from applying generic solutions without understanding specific business context. We've helped several companies succeed after previous disappointments by taking a fundamentally different approach - starting with deep understanding of your unique situation rather than force-fitting standard solutions. Our insurance client had tried automation multiple times before achieving success with our context-first approach."
        },

        "roi_skeptical": {
          "question": "How do we know we'll see ROI?",
          "answer": "We understand ROI skepticism given the industry's mixed track record. Our approach focuses on identifying specific, measurable opportunities during our initial assessment. We've documented significant results: the procurement case identified £200K in hidden costs, the insurance implementation achieved 150% conversion improvement with substantial annual savings. We build clear metrics into every engagement and report progress transparently. Before any major implementation, we work with you to validate the business case and ensure alignment on expected outcomes."
        },

        "internal_team": {
          "question": "Can't we just build this internally?",
          "answer": "Internal development is certainly possible, though it often takes longer and costs more than expected. We bring cross-industry experience and proven patterns that can accelerate your success. Our insurance client had been working on their conversion challenge internally before we helped them achieve breakthrough results. The value we typically provide isn't just in building the solution, but in knowing which approaches work, which pitfalls to avoid, and how to navigate the complexities of context-aware AI. We also focus on knowledge transfer so your team can maintain and evolve what we build together."
        },

        "security_concerns": {
          "question": "How do you handle data security/privacy?",
          "answer": "Security and privacy are paramount in all our implementations. We work within your existing security requirements and compliance frameworks, whether that requires on-premise deployment, private cloud configurations, or using your current infrastructure. Our approach often actually improves security - for example, in the insurance case, simplifying the architecture reduced the potential attack surface. For sensitive situations, we've successfully worked with anonymized or public domain data while still delivering valuable insights. We adapt to your security needs rather than asking you to compromise them."
        },

        "industry_experience": {
          "question": "Do you have experience in our industry?",
          "answer": "We've worked across multiple industries including insurance, procurement, education, financial services, and healthcare. However, what makes our approach valuable is that Context-First methodology means we learn YOUR specific situation rather than applying generic industry templates. Interestingly, some of our best insights come from cross-industry experience - for instance, patterns we discovered in procurement helped us identify optimization opportunities in insurance. The methodology of understanding context deeply applies regardless of industry."
        },

        "scale_concern": {
          "question": "Can this scale across our organization?",
          "answer": "Scalability is built into our approach. The insurance brokerage case demonstrated significant capacity increases without proportional resource growth. Our solutions are designed to grow with your needs - we typically prove value in one area first, then expand to adjacent areas as success builds confidence. By eliminating unnecessary complexity rather than adding layers, we create systems that can scale efficiently. Each successful implementation makes the next one faster and more valuable as patterns and learnings accumulate."
        },

        "maintenance": {
          "question": "What happens after implementation?",
          "answer": "We design solutions to be maintainable by your team, with knowledge transfer built into our process. The insurance brokerage case showed how simplifying architecture can actually reduce maintenance burden significantly. While we can provide ongoing support if needed, our goal is to enable your self-sufficiency. Many clients engage us periodically for optimization as their context evolves or new opportunities arise. We provide documentation, training, and establish clear handover processes to ensure sustainability."
        },

        "why_now": {
          "question": "Why is this urgent now?",
          "answer": "According to Accenture, 75% of executives believe they must scale AI within 5 years or risk significant competitive disadvantage. The gap between organizations with effective AI and those without is widening rapidly. While competitors struggle with generic AI implementations that underdeliver, early movers in context-aware AI are establishing lasting advantages. For example, our insurance client moved from 20% to 50% conversion while competitors still rely on manual processes. The sooner you start with the right approach, the greater your competitive advantage."
