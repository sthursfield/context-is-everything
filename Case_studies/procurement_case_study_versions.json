        "executive_summary": "## £15M Procurement Decision: From 3 Weeks to 48 Hours\n\n**The Challenge:** A major sports venue needed to evaluate four international catering suppliers for a £15-18M annual contract, with 300+ pages of complex documentation per supplier and just 14 days to decide.\n\n**The Context:** Each supplier used different formats (Excel, PDF, Word), different pricing models, and different assumptions. Manual analysis would take weeks the finance director didn't have.\n\n**The Solution:** We deployed AI to analyze 1,200+ pages in 48 hours, uncovering £200K+ in hidden costs and creating board-ready presentations with complete audit trails.\n\n**The Result:** 95% time reduction, critical anomalies discovered that would have cost millions, enterprise-grade documentation delivered.\n\n### The Hidden £200K Discovery\n\nOne supplier looked cheapest on paper - until our AI noticed they'd staffed 40% fewer people than competitors. Buried in the assumptions: the client would provide sales staff. That's £200K annually not shown in their proposal.\n\nAnother supplier projected 15% annual growth in a market where 5-7% is realistic. Without context-aware analysis, these critical details would have been missed.\n\n**Key Insight:** Complex procurement isn't just about comparing numbers - it's about understanding the context behind them. When AI understands industry benchmarks, staffing norms, and realistic growth rates, it catches what humans miss in the data avalanche.\n\n**Why This Matters:** This wasn't just faster analysis - it was better analysis. The AI didn't just process documents; it understood the stadium catering context and identified anomalies that would have cost millions.",
        
        "key_metrics": "- **Analysis Time:** 2-3 weeks → 48 hours (95% reduction)\n- **Hidden Costs Found:** £200K+ annually\n- **Documents Processed:** 1,200+ pages\n- **ROI:** 4000%+ first year return\n- **Quality:** Enterprise-grade audit trails",
        
        "lessons_learned": "The biggest revelation? AI doesn't replace expert judgment - it amplifies it. The finance director's expertise guided the AI, while the AI handled the heavy lifting of data extraction, standardization, and anomaly detection.\n\nThis proved that context-aware AI can transform traditional business processes, turning overwhelming complexity into clear, actionable intelligence."
