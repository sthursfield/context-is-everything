        "executive_summary": "## Educational Transparency: Protecting Architecture Students Through Contract Analysis\n\n**The Challenge:** Architecture students faced a critical institutional transition with 92 pages of complex legal contracts that could expose them to significant financial and legal risks.\n\n**The Context:** The London School of Architecture was merging with another institution. Students needed to understand their rights, financial exposure, and what the transition meant for their education - but the contracts were impenetrable.\n\n**The Solution:** We analyzed every page of legal documentation, verified 75+ sources, and created comprehensive risk assessments that students could actually understand.\n\n**The Result:** Complete transparency published free online, revealing critical risks like potential 10% annual fee increases and complete liability for workplace injuries during placements.\n\n### The Real Story\n\nImagine signing up for a £36,000 master's degree without understanding that fees could increase 10% each year, or that you have zero protection if something goes wrong during your mandatory work placement.\n\nThat's exactly the situation architecture students faced. The contracts were there, technically 'transparent,' but written in legal language that might as well have been encrypted.\n\nWe discovered shocking gaps: students had just 14 days for a full refund, the university completely disclaimed liability for practice placements, and fee increases up to 10% annually were permitted without caps.\n\n**Key Insight:** Educational institutions rely on information asymmetry. When you decode their contracts and make them truly transparent, you shift power back to students who can now make informed decisions.\n\n**Why This Matters:** This wasn't about attacking the institution - it was about empowering students with the context they needed to understand their commitments. Every educational contract should be this transparent.",
        
        "key_metrics": "- **Analysis Scope:** 92 pages decoded into plain English\n- **Research Depth:** 75+ verified sources\n- **Risk Identified:** Up to £3,600 additional cost exposure\n- **Refund Window:** Only 14 days for full protection\n- **Public Impact:** Free access for all students",
        
        "lessons_learned": "The biggest revelation? Educational institutions aren't deliberately hiding things - they're just not incentivized to make them clear. When you apply context-aware analysis to decode their language, you discover risks that students never knew they were taking.\n\nThis project proved that transparency doesn't require permission. Using only public documents, we created more clarity than the institution itself provided."
