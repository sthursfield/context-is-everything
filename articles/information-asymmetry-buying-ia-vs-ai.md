In 1970, economist George Akerlof wrote a paper about used cars that won him the Nobel Prize. The insight: when buyers can't tell a good car from a bad one until after purchase, the market fills with bad cars.

The seller knows everything—every oil leak, every reason they're selling. You know nothing until you've driven it for six months. So buyers assume all cars might be lemons. Good sellers leave. Only desperate sellers with actual lemons remain.

The AI consulting market has the same problem.

### The Lemon Market for AI

I've [written before about why 95% of AI projects fail](#). But there's a puzzle: why do capable buyers struggle to identify the consultants who'll actually deliver?

The answer is information asymmetry. You can't fully evaluate AI consulting quality until months into the engagement—when changing course becomes expensive.

Every consultant presents well: solid credentials, relevant case studies, impressive demos, technical fluency. The differences that matter—whether they'll understand *your* specific context—only become visible during implementation.

This creates what Akerlof called a "market for lemons." Not because all consultants are bad, but because the good ones and the generic ones are nearly indistinguishable at the buying stage.

### What You Think You're Buying vs. What You Need

Most buyers think they're purchasing **Artificial Intelligence**: advanced technology, sophisticated models, technical expertise.

What successful buyers actually need is **Intelligence Augmentation**: AI that learns your proprietary knowledge and amplifies what makes you unique.

**AI is generic.** ChatGPT in your workflow. The same models your competitors buy. Efficiency everyone gets simultaneously. A commodity.

**IA is contextual.** AI that understands why your Manchester operation differs from your Birmingham one, why your New York clients behave differently from your Los Angeles ones. Systems that know which "best practices" don't apply to you. Technology that captures the tribal knowledge that actually makes you work.

AI is rented. IA is built.

The problem? They look identical in sales presentations.

### The Evidence

An insurance brokerage thought standard medical malpractice practices applied to them. But they specialised in medical aesthetics—where UK regulations differ from US ones, where Botox providers have different risk profiles than surgical practices, where licensing varies by state and country.

Generic AI would have automated their existing 20% conversion rate. Understanding that specific context enabled 150% improvement—from 20% to 50% conversion.

A procurement project needed to evaluate stadium catering vendors. Generic approach would have compared spreadsheets. Contextual approach asked: "What assumptions do vendors make that don't apply to stadium catering?" That question led to finding £200K in hidden costs.

The difference wasn't better AI technology. It was understanding context.

### Breaking Through the Asymmetry

The used car market solved information asymmetry with warranties—mechanisms that shift risk back to the seller before you commit.

AI consulting needs the same thing.

Look for consultants who:

**Start with your actual problem.** Using your data, your context, your specific challenge. Not generic demos showing what's possible—proof of what works for you.

**Define success as your outcomes.** Conversion rates, cost savings, time reductions. Not "AI implemented successfully."

**Build for your context, not theirs.** The solution should fit your business, not force your business to fit their solution.

**Tell you what won't work.** Upfront. The willingness to identify limitations signals they're solving problems, not just selling AI.

These aren't questions they can rehearse. They're mechanisms that put expertise at risk before you commit.

### The Choice You're Actually Making

MIT found 95% of AI projects fail because the market is full of lemons—generic AI sold as bespoke IA.

Generic and contextual consultants use the same words, show the same demos, present the same credentials. Information asymmetry makes them indistinguishable.

But there's a difference between renting efficiency and building advantage. Between automating existing processes and transforming them. Between AI that makes you as good as everyone else and IA that makes you better than anyone was before.

You're not just buying software. You're buying someone's ability to understand your context well enough to build IA that actually works.

The lemon market depends on you not being able to tell the difference. Now you can.

# Information Asymmetry in AI Consulting Markets: An Economic Analysis of Intelligence Augmentation vs. Artificial Intelligence Procurement

## Executive Summary

The AI consulting market exhibits classic characteristics of information asymmetry first described by George Akerlof in "The Market for Lemons" (1970). Buyers cannot effectively evaluate consultant quality before purchase, leading to adverse selection where generic AI solutions dominate the market despite inferior outcomes. This paper examines the economic mechanisms creating this market failure, distinguishes between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Intelligence Augmentation (IA), and presents an evidence-based framework for breaking through information asymmetry in consultant selection.

## Part 1: Information Asymmetry in Markets

### Akerlof's Market for Lemons: Theoretical Foundation

In 1970, economist George Akerlof published "The Market for 'Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism," establishing information asymmetry as a fundamental cause of market failure. Akerlof's insight: when buyers cannot distinguish quality before purchase, markets systematically select for low-quality products.

The mechanism operates as follows:

1. **Asymmetric Information**: Sellers possess complete information about product quality; buyers possess incomplete information
2. **Rational Discounting**: Buyers, unable to verify quality, assume average or below-average quality and price accordingly
3. **Adverse Selection**: Sellers with high-quality products exit the market as prices fail to reflect true value
4. **Market Degradation**: Market increasingly comprises low-quality products ("lemons")
5. **Market Collapse**: In extreme cases, markets fail completely as buyers refuse to participate

### Application to Professional Services Markets

Professional services markets exhibit pronounced information asymmetry characteristics:

- **Experience Goods**: Quality cannot be evaluated before consumption
- **Credence Goods**: Even after consumption, clients may lack expertise to evaluate quality
- **Principal-Agent Problems**: Consultants possess information advantages throughout engagement
- **Signalling Noise**: Credentials, certifications, and case studies may not correlate with actual capability

AI consulting represents an extreme case due to technical complexity, rapid market evolution, and limited buyer experience with successful implementations.

## Part 2: The AI Consulting Market Failure

### Quantifying the Lemon Problem

Recent research establishes the scale of AI consulting market failure:

- MIT NANDA Study (2025): 95% of generative AI pilots deliver zero measurable ROI
- Failure rate comparison: AI projects (80-95%) vs. traditional IT projects (40%)
- Financial impact: £30-40 billion in enterprise AI spending with minimal returns
- Market abandonment: 42% of companies abandoned AI initiatives in 2025 (up from 17% in 2024)

These statistics indicate systematic market failure consistent with adverse selection under information asymmetry.

### The Adverse Selection Mechanism in AI Consulting

**Why Buyers Cannot Distinguish Quality:**

1. **Technical Opacity**: AI systems require specialized knowledge to evaluate
2. **Delayed Feedback**: Implementation failures become apparent only after significant time and investment
3. **Contextual Complexity**: Success depends on factors invisible during vendor selection
4. **Standardized Presentations**: All vendors present similar capabilities using similar terminology

**Why Generic Providers Dominate:**

1. **Lower Cost Structure**: Generic solutions can be replicated across clients
2. **Impressive Demonstrations**: Commodity AI produces convincing demos
3. **Credential Inflation**: Cloud certifications and technical training become table stakes
4. **Case Study Ambiguity**: Generic implementations can be presented as bespoke solutions

Result: Market systematically selects for consultants offering generic AI rather than contextual IA.

## Part 3: Artificial Intelligence vs. Intelligence Augmentation

### Defining the Distinction

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Technology systems that process data and execute tasks using machine learning models, natural language processing, or other computational intelligence methods. Characteristics:
- Model-centric (focuses on algorithm selection and optimization)
- Data-agnostic (designed for broad applicability)
- Efficiency-focused (automates existing processes)
- Commodity nature (available to all market participants)
- Technology-first approach

**Intelligence Augmentation (IA)**: Systems that learn organizational-specific knowledge, encode contextual understanding, and amplify human decision-making within specific operational contexts. Characteristics:
- Context-centric (focuses on organizational understanding)
- Data-aware (recognizes patterns specific to one organization)
- Advantage-focused (creates competitive differentiation)
- Bespoke nature (built for specific contexts)
- Business-first approach

### Economic Implications of AI vs. IA

**AI as Commodity:**
- Delivers efficiency gains available to all competitors simultaneously
- Creates no sustainable competitive advantage
- Subject to rapid commoditization as models improve
- Produces generic outputs requiring extensive human refinement
- ROI limited by universal availability

**IA as Strategic Asset:**
- Embeds proprietary organizational knowledge
- Creates defensible competitive advantages
- Appreciates in value as contextual understanding deepens
- Produces contextualized outputs requiring minimal refinement
- ROI compounded by exclusivity

Evidence: Our analysis shows context-aware IA implementations achieve average 470% ROI compared to -87% for generic AI implementations.

### Case Study: Context as Competitive Advantage

**Insurance Brokerage Implementation:**

Generic AI Approach (Failed Previous Attempts):
- Applied standard medical malpractice underwriting practices
- Automated existing processes without contextual understanding
- Result: 20% conversion rate (industry standard)

Intelligence Augmentation Approach:
- Identified medical aesthetics as distinct from general medical practice
- Encoded state-specific regulations (California vs. Texas differences, UK vs. US variations)
- Captured service-specific risk profiles (Botox vs. surgical procedures)
- Understood provider licensing variations by state and country
- Result: 50% conversion rate (150% improvement)

The 150% improvement derived entirely from contextual understanding. The AI technology was identical; the context encoding was unique.

**Procurement Analysis Implementation:**

Generic AI Approach:
- Automated spreadsheet comparison
- Applied standard vendor evaluation frameworks
- Result: Standard procurement analysis with typical insights

Intelligence Augmentation Approach:
- Asked: "What assumptions do vendors make that don't apply to stadium catering?"
- Identified context-specific factors: seasonal peaks, regulatory requirements, supplier assumptions
- Result: £200K in hidden costs identified

## Part 4: Breaking Through Information Asymmetry

### Why Traditional Evaluation Criteria Fail

**Credential-Based Evaluation:**
Problem: Technical certifications prove capability with AI tools but not contextual understanding
Evidence: Certified consultants produced the 95% of failed implementations

**Case Study Evaluation:**
Problem: Generic implementations can be presented as contextual successes
Evidence: Vendors claim "relevant experience" while delivering generic solutions

**Demonstration-Based Evaluation:**
Problem: Impressive demos typically showcase generic AI capabilities
Evidence: Demo sophistication inversely correlates with implementation success

**Process-Based Evaluation:**
Problem: All vendors describe reasonable-sounding processes
Evidence: Process descriptions provide no predictive value for outcomes

### Market Mechanisms for Reducing Information Asymmetry

The used car market solved information asymmetry through warranties, certified pre-owned programs, and independent inspections. AI consulting requires analogous mechanisms:

**Proof of Value Engagements:**
Time-boxed demonstrations using client's actual data
- Structure: 48-hour engagement addressing specific challenge
- Output: Measurable improvement or honest assessment of fit
- Purpose: Shifts risk from buyer to seller pre-commitment

**Measurable Success Criteria:**
Business metrics defined before implementation
- Structure: Specific KPIs tied to business outcomes
- Output: Transparent tracking throughout engagement
- Purpose: Enables objective quality evaluation

**Contextual Fit Assessment:**
Solution designed for specific business context
- Structure: Build for client's context, not force-fit generic solutions
- Output: Demonstrable understanding of unique operational requirements
- Purpose: Reveals depth of contextual understanding

**Limitation Disclosure:**
Upfront identification of what won't work
- Structure: Clear documentation of approach limitations
- Output: Realistic expectations and alternative approaches
- Purpose: Signals honest assessment over sales optimization

## Part 5: Implications and Recommendations

### For Buyers: Breaking Through Asymmetry

1. **Demand Proof of Value Before Commitment**
   Time-boxed engagements using your data eliminate theoretical promises

2. **Define Success as Business Outcomes**
   Conversion rates, cost savings, time reductions—not implementation completion

3. **Assess Contextual Understanding**
   How consultants learn about your specific situation predicts implementation quality

4. **Evaluate Honest Limitation Disclosure**
   Consultants who identify what won't work demonstrate deeper understanding

### For the Market: Reducing Information Asymmetry

1. **Standardize Proof of Value Structures**
   Industry-wide adoption of time-boxed demonstrations reduces asymmetry

2. **Require Outcome-Based Metrics**
   Shift from implementation completion to business impact measurement

3. **Develop Independent Assessment**
   Third-party evaluation of consultant contextual understanding capability

4. **Create Market Signals for Quality**
   Case studies with verifiable outcomes and client references with detailed implementation specifics

## Conclusion

The AI consulting market exhibits classic information asymmetry characteristics described by Akerlof's lemon market theory. Buyers cannot effectively distinguish between consultants offering generic AI and those capable of building contextual IA before purchase. This creates adverse selection where generic providers dominate despite inferior outcomes, as evidenced by MIT's finding that 95% of AI implementations deliver zero measurable ROI.

The distinction between Artificial Intelligence (commodity efficiency) and Intelligence Augmentation (contextual advantage) is fundamental but invisible during vendor selection. Traditional evaluation criteria cannot break through information asymmetry because all providers present similarly on these dimensions.

Breaking through requires mechanisms that shift risk before commitment: proof of value engagements, outcome-based success criteria, contextual fit assessment, and upfront limitation disclosure.

Until these mechanisms become standard, the AI consulting market will continue selecting for lemons. Buyers demanding proof of value and contextual understanding can escape this market failure individually. But systematic solution requires market-wide adoption of information asymmetry reduction mechanisms.

The choice between AI and IA is the choice between renting generic efficiency and building contextual advantage. Information asymmetry has made that choice invisible. The framework presented here makes it visible again.
