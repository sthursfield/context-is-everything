# The Hidden Costs in Your Vendor Proposals

We found £200,000 hidden in a vendor proposal last week.

Not through negotiation. Not through efficiency gains. It was hiding in plain sight on page 247 of a 300-page document.

The client nearly signed a contract that looked competitive on paper but contained substantial concealed costs. They're not alone - every complex vendor proposal contains hidden expenses.

Here's how to find yours before signing.

## How Costs Hide

Vendor proposals hide costs through three main methods:

**Method 1: Shifting Responsibilities**

One proposal stated "training provided" whilst another included "comprehensive training programme". Sounds similar, right?

The difference: £45,000 annually. The first vendor's "training" meant online documentation. The second included on-site sessions, materials, and ongoing support.

Both technically told the truth. One just shifted the actual training cost to the client.

**Method 2: Unrealistic Assumptions**

A catering proposal assumed 15% year-on-year growth. Sounds optimistic and positive.

The problem: it was built into the pricing model. If growth didn't materialise, unit costs would increase significantly. The client's actual growth? 3% annually.

That unrealistic assumption represented £80,000 in hidden costs over the contract term.

**Method 3: Missing Standard Inclusions**

The most expensive trick is what's not mentioned. One vendor's proposal was £50,000 cheaper than competitors.

Investigation revealed they'd excluded items other vendors included as standard: backup support, certain integrations, and specific reporting capabilities.

Adding those excluded items? The "cheaper" option became the most expensive.

## The Detection Framework

Finding hidden costs requires three steps:

**Step 1: Establish Baselines**

Before comparing proposals, research what's normally included in your industry. Talk to peers. Review industry standards. Understand the complete picture.

Without baselines, you can't recognise what's missing.

**Step 2: Standardise Proposals**

Complex proposals use different structures, making comparison difficult. Before evaluating, translate everything into a common format.

Identify every responsibility, assumption, and inclusion across all proposals. Create a matrix showing what each vendor actually provides.

**Step 3: Question Everything**

For every line item:
- Who's responsible for this in practice?
- What happens if assumptions don't hold?
- What's not mentioned that should be?

Read footnotes. Challenge vague language. Verify every assumption against your reality.

## The £200,000 Discovery

The procurement case involved a major sports venue's catering contract. Three vendors submitted proposals ranging from £3.2M to £3.8M annually.

The middle proposal looked strongest: competitive pricing, reasonable terms, solid references.

Detailed analysis revealed:
- Missing backup catering provisions (£30K annually)
- Optimistic growth projections (£80K risk)
- Excluded equipment maintenance (£25K annually)  
- Shifted training responsibilities (£45K annually)
- Unrealistic staffing assumptions (£20K annually)

The "competitive" £3.4M proposal was actually £3.6M once hidden costs were included. The initially expensive £3.8M proposal included everything and was actually the best value.

## What This Means for You

Hidden costs aren't about vendor dishonesty. They're about complexity creating places for costs to hide.

Every complex procurement contains them. Our experience suggests 5-10% of contract value typically remains concealed through these methods.

The question isn't whether your proposals contain hidden costs. It's whether you'll find them before signing.

## Your Action Plan

Before your next vendor decision:

**Before RFP Review:**
- Research industry baselines for what should be included
- Document standard provisions and responsibilities
- Create comparison templates

**During Review:**
- Flag every deviation from baseline
- Read every footnote and assumption
- Question vague language
- Standardise before comparing

**Before Deciding:**
- Quantify all hidden costs
- Validate growth projections against your reality
- Confirm responsibility allocation
- Calculate true total cost

## The Bottom Line

Context matters in procurement. Understanding what normal looks like lets you spot what's missing.

The £200,000 we found wasn't unusual - it was typical. But it required systematic analysis to uncover because complexity obscures truth.

You don't need AI to find these costs. You need context - understanding your industry well enough to recognise anomalies.

Your next vendor proposal contains hidden costs. The question is whether you'll find them before signing.
