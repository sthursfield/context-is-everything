  "commonQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "How much does AI implementation really cost?",
      "answer": "Software licensing is typically only 30-40% of total AI implementation costs. Full costs include integration (25-35%), training and change management (20-25%), and ongoing maintenance (15-20%). A £1,200 annual subscription often becomes £3,500-4,000 total cost. Mid-sized implementations range £80K-£400K.",
      "relatedArticles": ["complete-cost-of-ai", "hidden-vendor-costs"]
    },
    {
      "question": "When should we use AI vs when should we not?",
      "answer": "AI makes sense when: problem is high-volume/repetitive, accuracy requirements are 70-85%, you have adequate data, and ROI timeline is under 12 months. Avoid AI for: low-volume complex decisions, ethical/moral judgments, extreme accuracy requirements (>95%), or rapidly changing parameters.",
      "relatedArticles": ["signs-you-need-ai", "where-to-start-with-ai"]
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do so many AI projects fail?",
      "answer": "95% of AI projects fail (MIT study). Common mistakes: starting too broad, underestimating real costs, expecting perfect data, treating AI as set-and-forget, skipping human oversight, forcing adoption, and measuring wrong things. Successful implementations start small, measure honestly, and treat AI as experiments.",
      "relatedArticles": ["why-ai-projects-fail", "8-ai-mistakes", "7-ai-mistakes-retreat"]
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between your approach and traditional AI consulting?",
      "answer": "We treat AI initiatives as experiments, not implementations. This shifts focus from binary success/failure to learning and iteration. We emphasize context-specific solutions over standardized frameworks, pragmatic data standards over perfection, and incremental value demonstration over big-bang deployments.",
      "relatedArticles": ["7-ai-mistakes-retreat", "information-asymmetry"]
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does AI implementation take?",
      "answer": "Pilot phase: 4-8 weeks for limited scope validation. Scaling: 8-16 weeks for broader deployment. Optimization: ongoing. Most organizations see meaningful results in 3-6 months, but factor in 50% contingency for initial timelines. Quick wins should be demonstrable within first pilot phase.",
